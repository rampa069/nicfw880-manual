# nicFW880 ALPHA 19

**Date:** September 4

This update brings a main new feature and a handful of important tweaks. Here's what's new in ALPHA 19:

## 🔑 Key Features

**Scan Presets:** now supported with up to 99 presets.

- **Default Activation Key:** LP-1 (can be reassigned).
- New "Scanning" menus: Load, Delete, and Save presets.

## 📋 How It Works

- In the Scan Preset Menu, use **Up/Down** or **0–9** to pick a preset.
- Press **Green** to start scanning.
- **Long-press Green (LP-Green)** to edit the preset name.
- All of this is also configurable in **RMS → Scan Presets tab**.

👉 **Note:** The Scan Preset menu only opens if you have at least one preset assigned and you're in VFO mode.

## ⚡ Other Updates

- RMS can now load CHIRP CSVs.
- Charging icon added.
- Several BTS tweaks and bug fixes reported since 18a.

## ⚠️ Known Limitation

I didn't add the long-press Scan Preset Menu action into RMS yet. If you want to reconfigure the activation key, you'll need to do it directly on the radio for now. Thanks for your patience!
