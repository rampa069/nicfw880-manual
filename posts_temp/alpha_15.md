# nicFW880 ALPHA 15

**Date:** August 18

## !!The firmware DOES NOT support sub 300 serial number radios!!

## Power Calibration

There's a default calibration setup present on starting the RMS. This is based on my radio so you may have to fine tune for your own. You may use the earlier release diagnostic firmware to experiment and discover power settings (bias & gains).

## New Features

### Roger Beep:
Yes yes I know, I said I wouldn't add such a thing. But this radio is going to be used by CBers, and they do like their Bleepy Bleeps.

### Timeout Dimming of LCD
LCD will now timeout during scanning.
TX will now wake up the LCD.

### AF Filters added

### Multiwatch VFO Switch:
Determines if multiwatch will stay on the detected VFO or switch back after signal loss.

### Added Noise Gate

### Added right click menu to channels tab in RMS

### Function Menu added:
By default this is **LP-GREEN**. It opens a menu allowing you to browse and select any user function and activate it.

### Added key beeps:
I know many don't use this but I do. I just like some feedback from pressing a key. The menu option selects the frequency of the beep tone.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed error of RX frequency disappearing on TX.
