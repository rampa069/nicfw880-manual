# nicFW880 BETA 04 Release üöÄ

## macOS Versions of the RMS

macOS builds of the RMS are provided on a "compile and hope" basis. Since I don't have the ability to test or verify them, please don't expect direct support if issues arise. Any problems on macOS will need to be worked out within the community.

That said, an experienced macOS user has confirmed these versions do work, but with a few caveats:

- **BAUD must be set to 38400 at all times.**
- You may need to take extra steps like removing quarantine flags or adjusting file permissions.

If you're comfortable with those procedures, feel free to dive in.

üëâ The MacOS versions of the RMS can be downloaded from GitHub.

A huge thanks to Ramon Martinez for setting this up for everyone! üôè

## Unsupported iRadio Models

Some early iRadio models are not compatible with nicFW. A quick way to spot them: during firmware flashing, the screen turns white instead of black.

This happens due to hardware differences in the LCD backlight, which prevent nicFW880 from functioning correctly. Unfortunately, since these devices are long out of production, I can't obtain one for testing, so they remain unsupported.
