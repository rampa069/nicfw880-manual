Hey everyone!
Here is the ALPHA 17 release of nicFW880. This update brings some important refinements and new functionality, especially for the Si4732 Tuner Module.

## üîß Key Changes

### Squelch hysteresis
- Defaults adjusted
- Split into ExNoise and RSSI settings
- Range limits extended to 20

### Si4732 Tuner Module
- Now supports **LW, MW, and SW bands**
- Presets can be created/edited with the RMS app or through the CMS menu
- Presets are stored/numbered just like regular channel slots

**Note:** Tuner Presets in the RMS do not need any band information. The band is inferred from the frequency.

**Shortwave split into three bands:**
- **SW1** = 1.7 ‚Äì 6.0 MHz
- **SW2** = 6.0 ‚Äì 12 MHz
- **SW3** = 12 ‚Äì 30 MHz
