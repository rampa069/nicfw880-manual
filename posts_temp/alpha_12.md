# nicFW880 ALPHA 12

**Date:** August 13

## Changes

Firmware wise there's not a great deal changed other than a few tweaks here and there.

## Main Feature: Configurable UI

The main thing about this release is the **configurable UI**. This took ages to do because as you will see, there's so many things it needs to do.

I put together a very quick video to demonstrate this but I did it on my Linux box, and the screen capture messed up the recording :(

I anticipate a few issues will come to light with this after release due to the sheer complexity. It's doubtful I've accounted for everything.

### Key Updates:
- Configurable UI system introduced
- Various tweaks and refinements
