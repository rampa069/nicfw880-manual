# nicFW880 ALPHA 16 (FM Tuner Release)

## !!The firmware DOES NOT support sub 300 serial number radios!!

The big highlight of this release is the new **Si4732-based FM Tuner!** 🎶

It's still early days, so for now it only covers the FM broadcast band, but support for SSB, AM, SW, MW, and LW is on the way soon.

- **SP-Red** → Exit tuner / stop seeking
- **SP-#** → Seek forward
- **SP-\*** → Seek reverse
- **LP-#** → Toggle scope on/off
