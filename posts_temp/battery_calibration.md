# RT-880 / How to calibrate the battery

## Calibration Process

### Step 1: Full Charge Calibration
1. Charge battery fully. I.E. **FULLY CHARGED**
2. Open the Main Menu.
3. Select 'Calibration'
4. Adjust 'Batt V Cal' until the reading in the Extra Info area shows '8.4V'
5. Adjust 'Batt Full' to the same ADC value as shown in the Extra Info area.

### Step 2: Empty/Flat Calibration
1. Allow the battery to drain to what you consider to be almost flat.
2. Open the Main Menu.
3. Select 'Calibration'
4. Adjust 'Batt Flat' to the same ADC value as shown in the Extra Info area.

## Battery Voltage Information

**Note:** Battery nominal voltage and fully charged voltage are different. The battery's nominal voltage is 7.4V and that is what is written on it. But fully charged, the voltage of the battery is 8.4V.

### As a general rule:
- **8.4V** is fully charged
- **6.0V** is typically considered discharged

**However, you might want to up the lower limit, all of this is up to you, NOT ME!**
