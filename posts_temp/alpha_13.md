# nicFW880 Alpha 13 :: New Features & Improvements

The thirteenth alpha release of nicFW880 is here, bringing some new features and refinements.

**As always, remember that this will wipe all channels, bandplans, skins and fonts so make sure you have backed up to CSVs before flashing.**

## Manual DTMF & Repeater Tone

Manually send DTMF tones and set a custom repeater tone frequency.

**Note:** DTMF presets are not available yet :: they'll be coming in a future release.

Adjust repeater tone frequency in the Advanced menu category.

## Crossband Repeater (Long-press EMG)

Allows relaying between VHF and UHF.

### Setup requirements:

- VFO-A and VFO-B must be in simplex mode.
- Both must be allowed to transmit.
- One VFO on VHF, the other on UHF.
- Squelch must be closed.

### Controls while running:

- Press **RED** to exit XB Repeater mode.
- Press **STAR** to toggle the screen on/off.

## Screen Brightness Control

Day/Night modes added, each with individually adjustable brightness.

- **Quick toggle:** Short-press EMG to switch between Day and Night.
- Or, use the menu to manually select your preferred mode.

## Frequency Counter (Rapid Frequency Scanning) (Long-press 7)

Works similarly to previous models, but now includes HF mode:

- **Started Over 70 MHz:** Scans for signals on both VHF and UHF (as before).
- **Started Under 70 MHz:** Attempts to scan for HF signals only (untested).
