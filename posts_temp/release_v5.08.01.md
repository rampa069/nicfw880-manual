The RMS distributions DO NOT CONTAIN VIRUSES. If your browser or computer tells you they do then it's a false positive. I don't distribute malware and I don't appreciate direct or indirect accusations (I'm talking to you Patreon) that I do.

## What's New?

This release was mainly to level things out of beta, but there are a few upgrades to functionality.

### New Features

**Maidenhead locator system**

**Scrambler frequency upper limit increased to 4500 Hz**

### RMS Updates

**RMS 'Settings' Tab**
In preparation for the first mainstream release. (This was a lot of work)

**RMS 'Calibration' Tab**
