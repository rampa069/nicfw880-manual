## BETA 04E (October 4)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è APRS Is in EARLY STAGE

Not going to perform like other radios' APRS systems... YET! Incremental releases for testing.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Settings Reset

This update introduces new settings. Power on radio after flashing with **'EMG' button held down**.

Screen should display "DEFAULT SETTINGS" for moment before booting normally.

**Wait for red triangle to disappear before proceeding.**

**Continue using existing RMS BETA04 version.**

### New GPS Module Functions

**GPS Sync location changed:**
- Previously: Main Menu ‚Üí Time ‚Üí GPS Sync
- Now: **Main Menu ‚Üí GPS ‚Üí Enabled**

**This must be ON for any GPS functions to work.**

If turned off, radio will use fixed GPS locations.

**APRS Beacon with PTT:**
While PTT engaged, short press **S1** sends APRS location beacon.

**Default GPS Waypoint:**
- Waypoint 99 is default location
- If GPS off or radio is non-GPS, this waypoint loads at startup as current location
- Set any waypoint as current location by long-pressing RED while browsing waypoints

### APRS Sending (Receiving Coming Soon)

Works on all models (GPS capability not required).

**New settings under Main Menu ‚Üí APRS:**

- **APRS Deviation:** Controls loudness of APRS data
- **Beacon Time:** Minutes between location beacon transmissions
- **Beacon Distance (metres):** Sends beacon if traveled beyond this distance since last transmission
- **Beacon TX:** Sends APRS beacons at start/end of PTT
  - Uses existing DTMF Start Delay for timing
  - Works only in regular radio mode, not GPS module mode
- **Beacon Comment:** Custom comment (up to 24 characters) with each beacon
- **Callsign:** Set your callsign
- **Hear Tones:** Normally APRS data isn't audible. Enable for diagnostic purposes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Auto-transmitted beacons triggered by Beacon Time or Distance throttled to one per minute.**

### BETA 04E Update (Experimental)

**APRS decoding support** - VERY basic and rudimentary. Just pops up info when packet received.

**Remember to turn on MainMenu ‚Üí APRS ‚Üí Decode**

Also remember problem with squelch override. No solution yet.

**Fixed issues with radio lockup.**

---

## BETA 04F (October 13)

**IMPORTANT:** Perform settings reset before use.
- Hold EMG while powering on
- Wait for red triangle to vanish after power on

**Use BETA 04 RMS**

**Note:** Lots of work and new code. Almost certainly going to have some issues, don't expect 100% right away.

### MIC-E Beacon System

Configure via ‚Üí APRS Menu

- **SSID:** 0-7 (Sets secondary station ID)
- **Decode:** On/Off/Popup (Enables decoding of received APRS MIC-E packets)

- **Symbol:** ASCII Code (MIC-E Blip Symbol for transmitted packets)
- **Status:** 0-7 (MIC-E ABC Message field)
- **Digipeater Path:** Off, WIDE1-1, WIDE2-2
- **Ambiguity:** 20 m, 200 m, 2 km (Transmitted beacon location accuracy)

**Note:** 20m is best accuracy for MIC-E (1/100th of minute ‚âà 18m, rounded up for readability).

### Beacon List

In GPS module, **SP 6** opens "Heard Beacons" list menu (if at least one heard).

**Note:** Heard beacons not retained in storage.

**Controls:**
- UP/DOWN: Browse beacons
- RED: Exit beacon list menu

Configure via ‚Üí APRS Menu

- **KISS Mode:** Activate virtual TTNC
- **Persist:** 1 - 255 (Probability X in 255 that queued packet will be sent on clear frequency)
- **Slot Time:** 0-200 milliseconds (Delay time if Persist probability check fails)

### Audio Boost
